\usage{
cluster(
  data,
  norm_method = c("zScore", "Sigmoid", "RobustSigmoid", "MinMax"),
  unit_int = FALSE,
  clust_method = c("kmeans", "hclust", "mclust"),
  k = 2,
  features = NULL,
  na_removal = c("feature", "sample"),
  seed = 123,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{feature_calculations} object containing the raw feature matrix produced by \code{theft::calculate_features}}

\item{norm_method}{\code{character} denoting the rescaling/normalising method to apply. Can be one of \code{"zScore"}, \code{"Sigmoid"}, \code{"RobustSigmoid"}, \code{"MinMax"}, or \code{"MaxAbs"}. Defaults to \code{"zScore"}}

\item{unit_int}{\code{Boolean} whether to rescale into unit interval \code{[0,1]} after applying normalisation method. Defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{clust_method}{\code{character} specifying the clustering algorithm to use. Can be one of \code{"kmeans"} for k-means clustering, \code{"hclust"} for hierarchical clustering, or \code{"mclust"} for Gaussian mixture model clustering. Defaults to \code{"kMeans"}}

\item{k}{\code{integer} denoting the number of clusters to extract. Defaults to \code{2}}

\item{features}{\code{character} vector denoting the names of time-series features to use in the clustering algorithm. Defaults to \code{NULL} for no feature filtering and usage of the entire feature matrix}

\item{na_removal}{\code{character} defining the way to deal with NAs produced during feature calculation. Can be one of \code{"feature"} or \code{"sample"}. \code{"feature"} removes all features that produced any NAs in any sample, keeping the number of samples the same. \code{"sample"} omits all samples that produced at least one NA. Defaults to \code{"feature"}}

\item{seed}{\code{integer} to fix R's random number generator to ensure reproducibility. Defaults to \code{123}}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to \code{stats::kmeans} or \code{stats::hclust}, or \code{mclust::Mclust} depending on selection in \code{clust_method}}
