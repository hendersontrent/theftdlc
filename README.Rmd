Tools for Analysing and Interpreting Time Series Features

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
comment = NA, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 10, cache = FALSE)
```

## Installation

*Coming to CRAN soon!*

You can install the development version of `theftdlc` from GitHub using the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/theftdlc")
```

## General purpose

The [`theft`](https://hendersontrent.github.io/theft/) package for R facilitates user-friendly access to a structured analytical workflow for the extraction of time-series features from six different feature sets (or a set of user-supplied features): `"catch22"`, `"feasts"`, `"Kats"`, `"tsfeatures"`, `"tsfresh"`, and `"TSFEL"`.

`theftdlc` extends this feature-based ecosystem by providing a suite of functions for analysing, interpreting, and visualising time-series features calculated using `theft`. Functionality including data quality assessments and normalisation methods, low dimensional projections (linear and nonlinear), data matrix and feature distribution visualisations, time-series classification machine learning procedures, statistical hypothesis testing, and various other statistical and graphical tools.

A high-level overview of how the `theft` ecosystem for R is typically accessed by users is shown below. Many more functions and options for customisation are available within the packages.

### What's in a name?

`theftdlc` means 'downloadable content' (DLC) for `theft`---just like you get [DLCs and expansions](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring/shadow-of-the-erdtree) for video games.
