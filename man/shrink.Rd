\title{Use a cross validated penalized maximum likelihood generalized linear model to perform feature selection}
\usage{
shrink(data, threshold = c("one", "all"), plot = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{feature_calculations} object containing the raw feature matrix produced by \code{theft::calculate_features}}

\item{threshold}{\code{character} denoting whether to retain features that have at least one non-zero coefficient \code{"one"} across all group levels or features that have non-zero coefficients across all group levels \code{"all"}. Applicable to multinomial case only. Defaults to \code{"one"} for less aggressive filtering}

\item{plot}{\code{Boolean} whether to draw the misclassification error lambda plot for a \code{cv.glmnet} object. Defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to \code{glmnet::cv.glmnet}}
}
\value{
\code{feature_calculations} object containing a data frame of the reduced feature set
}
\description{
Use a cross validated penalized maximum likelihood generalized linear model to perform feature selection
}
\examples{

library(theft)

features <- theft::calculate_features(theft::simData,
  group_var = "process",
  feature_set = "catch22")

best_features <- shrink(features)
