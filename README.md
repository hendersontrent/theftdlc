Analyse and Interpret Time Series Features

## Installation

You can install the stable version of `theftdlc` from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("theftdlc")
```

You can install the development version of `theftdlc` from GitHub using
the following:

``` r
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/theftdlc")
```

## General purpose

The [`theft`](https://hendersontrent.github.io/theft/) package for R
facilitates user-friendly access to a structured analytical workflow for
the extraction of time-series features from six different feature sets
(and any number of individual user-supplied features): `"catch22"`,
`"feasts"`, `"kats"`, `"tsfeatures"`, `"tsfresh"`, and `"tsfel"`.

`theftdlc` extends this feature-based ecosystem by providing a suite of
functions for analysing, interpreting, and visualising time-series
features calculated using `theft`. Functionality including data quality
assessments and normalisation methods, low dimensional projections
(linear and nonlinear), data matrix and feature distribution
visualisations, time-series classification machine learning procedures,
statistical hypothesis testing, and various other statistical and
graphical tools.

A high-level overview of how the `theft` ecosystem for R is typically
accessed by users is shown below. Many more functions and options for
customisation are available within the packages.

### What’s in a name?

`theftdlc` means ‘downloadable content’ (DLC) for `theft`—just like you
get [DLCs and
expansions](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring/shadow-of-the-erdtree)
for video games.

## Quick tour

`theft` and `theftdlc` combine to create an intuitive and efficient tidy
feature-based workflow. Here is an example of a single code chunk that
calculates features using
[`catch22`](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22) and a custom set
of mean and standard deviation, and projects the feature space into an
interpretable two-dimensional space using principal components analysis:

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(theft)
library(theftdlc)

calculate_features(data = theft::simData, 
                   feature_set = "catch22",
                   features = list("mean" = mean, "sd" = sd)) %>%
  project(norm_method = "RobustSigmoid",
          unit_int = TRUE,
          low_dim_method = "PCA") %>%
  plot()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

In that example, `calculate_features` comes from `theft`, while
`project` and the `plot` generic come from `theftdlc`.

Similarly, we can perform time-series classification using a similar
simple workflow to compare the performance of `catch22` against our
custom set of the first two moments of the distribution:

``` r
calculate_features(data = theft::simData, 
                   feature_set = "catch22",
                   features = list("mean" = mean, "sd" = sd)) %>%
  classify(by_set = TRUE,
           n_resamples = 5,
           use_null = TRUE) %>%
  compare_features(by_set = TRUE,
                   hypothesis = "null") %>%
  head()
```

                    hypothesis  feature_set   metric  set_mean null_mean
    1 All features != own null All features accuracy 0.8177778 0.1644444
    2         User != own null         User accuracy 0.7955556 0.1200000
    3      catch22 != own null      catch22 accuracy 0.7511111 0.1377778
      t_statistic     p.value
    1    4.759301 0.008909773
    2    6.159351 0.003526169
    3    4.866885 0.008238202

In this example, `classify` and `compare_features` come from `theftdlc`.

of both packages.
